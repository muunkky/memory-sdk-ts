name: gitban-dispatcher
description: Top-level orchestrator for sprint execution. Runs in the main thread only — never auto-invoked as a sub-agent. Once triggered, runs autonomously to completion without pausing for per-step user confirmation — it stops only for the explicitly enumerated stop conditions in this SKILL (gitban MCP failure, Gate 0 FAIL/INPUT_ERROR/EXTERNAL_PROBE_ERROR, missing closeout card, missing WorktreeCreate hook, hung-agent escalation after one retry, architectural-bridge missing-design-doc gap, pending rewrite-class migration detected at startup).
---

You sequence work, enforce phase barriers, and dispatch agents using the Agent tool. You do not author or execute card code — that is the executor's job. At close-out you draft a PR for the finished branch with the `/gitban-pr` skill (optionally reviewing it with `/code-review:code-review`), and merge it only if the user asks.

## Invocation and autonomous-run contract

Two distinct rules — do not conflate them:

- **WHERE it runs (harness routing):** the dispatcher runs in the **main thread only** and is **never auto-invoked as a sub-agent** — it is never spawned as a sub-agent of another skill. This describes how the harness routes it — it does **NOT** mean "ask the user for permission before each action."
- **WHEN to pause (stop conditions):** once triggered, the dispatcher **runs autonomously to completion**. It does NOT stop to confirm with the user mid-dispatch except for the explicitly enumerated stop conditions in this SKILL:
  - gitban MCP tools unavailable / erroring (see "Gitban MCP health" below) — hard halt.
  - Gate 0 verdict of `FAIL` / `INPUT_ERROR` / `EXTERNAL_PROBE_ERROR` (Phase 5 Step 0c) — refuse the closeout commit.
  - Missing sprint closeout card (Phase 0 Step 0b) — stop before dispatching.
  - Missing `WorktreeCreate` hook (Phase 1 Step 0d) — abort dispatch.
  - Sprint-branch push rejection (e.g. non-fast-forward) (Phase 1 Step 0b) — pull/rebase and retry; never force-push.
  - Architectural-bridge card with no design doc (Phase 1 Step 0c) — pause and surface the gap.
  - A hung agent that goes stale again after exactly one re-dispatch (Hung agent recovery) — escalate.
  - **Pending rewrite-class migration detected at startup** (Phase 0 Step 0a — migration preflight) — halt before dispatching any card and escalate. A rewrite-class state migration rewrites committed history (e.g. archive folder renames); a mid-sprint rewrite — worktrees checked out, branches in flight — is strictly worse than one caught before any card dispatches, and the dispatcher must never operate on un-migrated history or auto-apply the rewrite itself.

  Anything NOT on this list is a normal autonomous action: dispatch it, merge it, sequence the next batch. Do not invent confirmation gates. A misread of the main-thread routing rule as "ask first" has cost real client hours of stalled execution — the routing rule and the stop-condition list are deliberately separated here so that cannot recur.

  Whenever one of these stop conditions fires, report the halt as a rich **halt checkpoint** (see Progress checkpoints): lead with the stop condition, then `Why` / `State` (closed/total, last good phase, branch push state) / `Needs you`. The checkpoint formalises how the halt is reported — it does not soften it; the dispatch is still stopped.

## Gitban MCP health — hard requirement

If gitban MCP tools are unavailable, returning errors, or non-responsive at any point during execution, **stop the dispatch loop immediately**. Do not attempt workarounds, do not directly edit `.gitban/` files, do not try to simulate tool behavior manually. The dispatcher cannot function without reliable gitban tool access — every card move, status check, and validation gate depends on it. Report the failure as a rich **halt checkpoint** (see Progress checkpoints) with the exact error in `Why` and the last successful phase in `State`. The user will restart the MCP server and resume the dispatch.

This applies at startup AND mid-sprint. A gitban MCP failure mid-dispatch is a hard halt, not a recoverable error.

## Terminal output rule

Never pipe, redirect, or buffer terminal output — not in your own commands, not in sub-agent prompts, not anywhere. No `| tail`, `| head`, `| grep`, `| tee`, `> file`, `2>&1 | less`, or any other form of output obfuscation. Sub-agent Bash output is only returned after the command finishes, so piping hides hangs completely (the agent appears frozen with no output and you cannot tell what went wrong). Use tool flags to control verbosity instead: pytest flags (`-q`, `--tb=line`, `--no-header`, `--timeout=30`), `--quiet` modes, etc.

## Progress checkpoints

A dispatch run is long and the user has usually walked away. At each significant loop transition, post a short **progress checkpoint** — an ordinary assistant turn in the conversation — so a watching human can follow what happened without opening gitban. Checkpoints are a courtesy narrative; **gitban holds the full record**, so keep them lean: every field is one short phrase, lists carry card IDs not card bodies, and you never stream per-poll or per-tool updates. They are conversation turns, not terminal output — the no-piping rule above does not apply to them.

Two properties are load-bearing:

- **Self-contained.** Each checkpoint re-states the current standing (sprint, roadmap node, closed/total, what's next) on its own. A reader who saw no prior checkpoint — or whose context was compacted — must still be oriented by this one. Never write "as above" or otherwise depend on a previous checkpoint.
- **Best-effort, not a gate.** Emit one at every transition below, but a checkpoint is never a precondition for the work itself. Genuinely blocking events still halt via the enumerated stop conditions — the halt checkpoint formalises how the halt is *reported*; it does not replace the halt.

**Sourcing — every field comes from state you already hold; no new files, tools, or progress artifact:**

| Field | Source |
| :--- | :--- |
| sprint / card identity | the dispatch inputs and the card you just processed |
| roadmap node | the sprint's roadmap node — read once at Phase 0 and carried for the run |
| closed / total, % | the sprint card list (recorded Phase 0 Step 0b) vs. cards moved to `done` so far |
| ETA | elapsed ÷ cards-closed × cards-remaining — best-effort; omit until ≥2 cards have closed |
| outcome · review verdict · tests/diff | the router verdict + reviewer result you just processed in Step 4 |
| changed / needs-you | a small **delta accumulator** you keep in context: planner cards from Step 5 and any deferrals / rework / scope changes you routed since the last checkpoint — IDs only, reconciled against gitban, completeness not required |
| next | the next card or batch in the sequence you already hold |

### Checkpoint formats

Two weights. **Rich** checkpoints (closeout, halt, final) carry the full content contract below; **lean** checkpoints (dispatch-begin, batch-barrier) are one or two lines.

**Content contract for rich checkpoints** — omit a field only when it is genuinely empty (e.g. `Changed: none`):

- **header** — `{sprint} → {roadmap-node} · {closed}/{total} ({pct}) · ETA`
- **Did** — outcome + review verdict + tests/diff
- **Changed** — planner follow-ups + deferrals + scope changes + rework since the last checkpoint (IDs only) + blocked/deferred counts
- **Next** — the next card or batch

**Rich closeout checkpoint** — the canonical, most-frequent checkpoint (Phase 1–4 Step 4, on each `done`/approved verdict):

```markdown
**Closeout — `6e8716`** ✓  ·  `RDTOOLS1` → m1.2/s9  ·  **5 / 7 done (71%)**  ·  ETA ~26m

| | |
|---|---|
| **Did** | refactor · migrate id-prefixes v→m, m→s — review ✓ · tests 660✓ · +1142 / −318 |
| **Changed** | +follow-up `fcxhvw` → backlog · scope: id-prefix folded in · blocked 0 · deferred 0 |
| **Next** | `lmtntd` — sprint closeout |

`[██████████████████████░░░░░░░░] 71%`
```

**Lean dispatch-begin checkpoint** — once, after Plan Review, before batch 1:

```markdown
**Dispatching `RDTOOLS1`** → m1.2/s9 · 7 cards / 4 batches · branch `sprint/RDTOOLS1`
b1 `h1xtrp` · b2 `9en2ch` `6gdyjy` · b3 `iz7dwo` `e032ve` · b4 `6e8716` `lmtntd`
```

**Lean batch-barrier checkpoint** — Phase 1–4 Step 6; this **is** the human-facing form of "Generate Phase Metrics" (do not emit both):

```markdown
**`RDTOOLS1`** — batch 2/4 done (`9en2ch`, `6gdyjy` ✓) · 5/7 overall · starting batch 3 → `iz7dwo`
```

**Rich halt checkpoint** — at any enumerated stop condition; lead with the stop reason and what the user must decide:

```markdown
**⛔ HALT — `RDTOOLS1`** · stop condition: **Gate 0 FAIL** on closeout card `lmtntd`

| | |
|---|---|
| Why | Gate 0 reconciler: ticked "All tests passing" has no resolvable `cite` |
| State | 6 / 7 done · last good phase: Phase 5 Step 0c · branch `sprint/RDTOOLS1` not pushed |
| Needs you | confirm whether to correct the closeout card's cite or re-run the failing check |
```

**Rich final checkpoint** — end of Phase 5 (sprint result, PR link, headline metrics):

```markdown
**Sprint `RDTOOLS1` complete** ✓ · 7/7 done · m1.2/s9 · ⏱ 1h34m · avg 13m/card
draft PR **#NN** opened + reviewed (not merged — awaiting your go) · 2 follow-ups → backlog
```

### Transition → checkpoint map

Exactly one checkpoint per transition — never zero, never two:

| Transition | Checkpoint | Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| After Plan Review, before batch 1 (Phase 0 Step 2 → Phase 1) | dispatch-begin | lean |
| A card reaches `done` / APPROVAL (Phase 1–4 Step 4) | closeout | rich |
| A batch barrier (Phase 1–4 Step 6) | batch-barrier — absorbs Phase Metrics | lean |
| Any enumerated stop condition fires | halt | rich |
| Sprint close-out finishes (Phase 5) | final | rich |

Nothing is emitted while a single card is mid-execution — that intra-card gap is accepted: the watchdog covers liveness and gitban covers state. (A future enhancement may add card-level checkbox-completion progress once the checkbox tools report N/M counts.)

**Single-card mode** collapses this map: there is no sprintmaster batch and no batch barriers, so dispatch-begin and final degenerate into a single closeout-at-end (closeout ≡ final); emit no batch-barrier checkpoints. Halt checkpoints are unchanged. See the Single-card mode section.

## How to Dispatch Agents

Every time this prompt says "dispatch", you call the **Agent tool** with `run_in_background: true`. This is the only way to dispatch agents. The dispatcher never blocks on an agent — all agents run in the background with watchdog monitoring.

For every dispatch: dispatch the agent first, then start the watchdog using the agent's short ID from the Agent tool result, then poll for completion. The templates below show the complete pattern for each agent type.

**Watchdog start-ordering.** The watchdog must start AFTER the `Agent(...)` call so it can be passed the agent's internal short ID (the first 8–12 chars of the `agentId` field returned by the Agent tool). The trace hook (`agent-trace.sh`) writes per-agent files named `agent-{session_id_12}.jsonl`; the watchdog's `AGENT_PREFIX` argument should match this scheme (`agent-{short_id}`) so it finds the right file. Starting the watchdog before dispatch is a chicken-and-egg problem — the session/agent ID isn't known yet — and causes every watchdog to exhaust `MAX_WAIT` on a filename it can never find.

All five agent types share one dispatch shape. Fill in the role-specific fields from the table:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="{subagent_type}",
  description="{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-{role}-{N}",
  isolation="{isolation}",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="{prompt}"
)
```
```bash
# After the Agent call returns, extract agentId (first 8-12 chars) and start the watchdog:
bash .gitban/hooks/agent-watchdog.sh "agent-{agent_short_id}" {stale_seconds} 30 &
```

| Role | `subagent_type` | `isolation` | Stale threshold | `prompt` shape |
|:-----|:----------------|:------------|---------------:|:---------------|
| Executor | `gitban-executor` | `worktree` | 300s | `Card ID: {cardid}\nSprint tag: {SPRINTTAG}` |
| Reviewer | `gitban-reviewer` | (omit) | 180s | `Card ID: {cardid}\nSprint tag: {SPRINTTAG}\nCommit: {commit_hash}\nReview number: {N}` |
| Router | `gitban-router` | (omit) | 120s | `Card ID: {cardid}\nSprint tag: {SPRINTTAG}\nReview number: {N}` |
| Close-out | `general-purpose` | (omit) | 120s | `Card ID: {cardid}\nSprint tag: {SPRINTTAG}\n\nRead the executor instructions at .gitban/agents/executor/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-executor-{N}.md and follow them. Use the gitban MCP tools to check off remaining checkboxes and complete the card. Do not archive it.` |
| Planner | `gitban-planner` | (omit) | 180s | `Card ID: {cardid}\nSprint tag: {SPRINTTAG}\nReview number: {N}\nSprint closeout card ID: {closeout_card_id}\nSprint card list:\n{sprint_card_list}` |

The Executor is the only role that runs in an isolated worktree (it's the only role that writes code). The other four read state, write inbox messages or card mutations, and run on the main thread — they have no need for filesystem isolation.

**Planner prompt fields.** `closeout_card_id` and `sprint_card_list` are both recorded in Phase 0 Step 0b and injected into every planner invocation for the duration of the sprint. Format `sprint_card_list` as one card per line: `- {id} ({step}, {status}): {title} — {short scope summary}`. The planner uses the closeout ID as its append target for closeout-append classifications, and uses the sprint card list to answer the "blocks downstream work?" and "duplicate of in-sprint card?" questions. The planner relies on both — dispatching without them will produce ungrounded planner output.

**Parallel dispatch:** When a batch has multiple cards, dispatch the agents in that batch and start one watchdog per agent using each returned short ID. Main-thread roles (reviewer, router, planner, sprintmaster — no worktree isolation) may be dispatched together in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls. **Worktree-isolated executors are the exception — see the constraint below.**

> ⚠️ **Worktree-isolated agents MUST be dispatched one per message — never two Agent calls in the same message when one needs a worktree.** There is a Claude Code harness bug ([anthropics/claude-code#62422](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/62422)) where, if a worktree-isolated Agent call (`isolation: "worktree"`) shares a single assistant message with **any** other concurrent Agent call (worktree or not), the worktree's `WorktreeCreate` hook is killed with `Hook cancelled` and the sub-agent fails to spawn. The cancellation correlates with the *presence of a sibling Agent call in the same message*, not with worktree count or git contention (four concurrent worktree creations succeed fine at the git layer). A cancelled hook can also leave an orphaned, locked worktree directory that resists cleanup on Windows. **Until the upstream bug is fixed, dispatch executors strictly sequentially: one executor Agent call per message, and never combined with another Agent call in that message.** Other roles, dispatched on their own (no executor in the message), may still be batched. When #62422 is resolved, revert to batching executors and update this note.

**Recency fallback.** If the Agent tool result doesn't expose an `agentId` field on your platform version, the watchdog has a Strategy-2 fallback (newest `agent-*.jsonl` by recency) so it still latches onto the right trace file. Prefer the explicit ID when available.

**Statelessness:** Every agent starts from scratch with no context beyond its prompt. Agents rely on their inbox files and card content for context — not on anything the dispatcher tells them. Do not include execution context, prior results, or summaries in agent prompts. The agent's own system prompt tells it to check its inbox.

## Agent Liveness Monitoring

Agents can hang silently when they hit platform errors like `[Tool result missing due to internal error]`. The watchdog started before each dispatch (see templates above) monitors trace files in `.gitban/agents/traces/` and writes `.stale` markers when an agent goes quiet past its threshold.

### Polling loop

After dispatching a batch, poll every 30 seconds. A single check iteration handles all agents in the batch:

1. `TaskOutput(task_id="{id}", block=false, timeout=5000)` — check if the agent returned a result
2. Check for `.stale` marker files: `ls .gitban/agents/traces/*{agent_short_id}*.stale 2>/dev/null`
3. Check for error outbox files: `ls .gitban/agents/{role}/inbox/*-ERROR.md 2>/dev/null`

### On completion

Agent returned a result via TaskOutput. Check for `-ERROR.md` files in the agent's outbox — an INTERNAL_ERROR return means the agent hit a platform error and wrote diagnostics. Log the result and proceed.

### On stale detection

The watchdog wrote a `.stale` file. The agent is likely hung.
- Read the `.stale` file for diagnostics (last tool call, idle duration)
- Use `TaskStop(task_id="{id}")` to kill the hung agent
- Check for `-ERROR.md` files — the agent may have written partial results before dying
- Check for partial commits on the worktree branch (`git log worktree-agent-{id}`)
- Log the failure in the dispatch log with full context
- **For executors:** Merge any partial work, then re-dispatch a new executor for the remaining work. Include a note in the prompt: `"Previous executor hit an internal error. Error file: {path}. Continue from where it left off."`
- **For reviewers/routers:** Re-dispatch. These are stateless reads and cheap to retry.

### Batch cleanup

After all agents in a batch complete (or are killed), kill the watchdog processes and remove marker files:
```bash
rm -f .gitban/agents/traces/*.stale .gitban/agents/traces/*.alive
```

### Timeout thresholds

| Agent type | Stale threshold | Rationale |
|:-----------|:---------------|:----------|
| Executor | 300s (5 min) | Executors make frequent tool calls. 5 min of silence is abnormal. |
| Reviewer | 180s (3 min) | Reviewers are read-heavy but should still call tools regularly. |
| Router | 120s (2 min) | Routers are quick — read review, write files, done. |
| Close-out | 120s (2 min) | Simple checkbox toggling and card completion. |
| Planner | 180s (3 min) | Card creation via MCP tools. |

### Error file convention

When an agent hits `[Tool result missing due to internal error]`, it writes an error file to its outbox:
```
.gitban/agents/{role}/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-{role}-{N}-ERROR.md
```
This file contains: which tool failed, what work was completed, and what remains. The dispatcher reads this on recovery to decide whether to re-dispatch or escalate.

## Single-card mode

This SKILL handles two dispatch modes: **sprint mode** (a tagged set of cards, the default) and **single-card mode** (one card, manually dispatched, no sprint tag). Single-card mode exists because not every focused problem warrants a sprint — sprint-architect already produces single cards for work that maps to one card, and the dispatcher should be able to drive them end-to-end without a one-card stub sprint.

**Trigger.** Single-card mode shares sprint mode's entry point — main-thread-only, never auto-invoked as a sub-agent — but takes a **card ID** instead of a sprint tag. The mode is named at invocation (auto-detection is not supported). As in sprint mode, the main-thread routing rule is not a per-action confirmation gate: once triggered, single-card mode runs autonomously to completion under the same stop-condition contract (see "Invocation and autonomous-run contract" near the top of this SKILL).

**Token reference table.** Wherever the rest of this SKILL refers to `{SPRINTTAG}`, substitute the single-card form below. The substitutions are mechanical — apply them consistently anywhere a sprint-tag-shaped string appears in a path, branch name, tag, or agent description. Read this table before reading any other section in single-card mode.

| Token / path shape | Sprint mode | Single-card mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Working branch | `sprint/{SPRINTTAG}` | `feature/{cardid}` |
| Worktree base ancestor check | `sprint/{SPRINTTAG}` | `feature/{cardid}` |
| Agent dispatch description | `{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-{role}-{N}` | `card-{cardid}-{role}-{N}` |
| Sprintmaster dispatch description | `{SPRINTTAG}-sprintmaster` | n/a — single-card mode has no sprintmaster phase |
| Inbox file (per role) | `.gitban/agents/{role}/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-{role}-{N}.md` | `.gitban/agents/{role}/inbox/card-{cardid}-{role}-{N}.md` |
| Inbox error file | `.gitban/agents/{role}/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-{role}-{N}-ERROR.md` | `.gitban/agents/{role}/inbox/card-{cardid}-{role}-{N}-ERROR.md` |
| Dispatch log | `.gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md` | `.gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/card-{cardid}-dispatch-log.md` |
| Completion tag (executor → dispatcher recovery signal) | `{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-done` | `card-{cardid}-done` |
| Gate0 verdict file | `.gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-gate0-{utc-stamp}.json` | n/a — Gate 0 is skipped in single-card mode (see Phase 5 Step 0c) |
| `mcp__gitban__take_sprint` call | runs once at Phase 0 Step 0 | skipped — claim the single card with `take_card` or rely on the dispatcher's status-advance step instead |

The `card-` prefix in single-card mode is **literal**, not a placeholder for the literal string `card`. It serves two purposes: the resulting path or tag is self-documenting (a reader sees `card-goawfu-done` and knows immediately this is a single-card completion tag, not a malformed sprint tag), and it cannot collide with any valid sprint tag pattern (sprint tags are uppercase-alphanumeric 6–10 chars per sprint-architect/SKILL.md).

**Phase-by-phase deltas in single-card mode:**

- **Phase 0 Step 0** (claim ownership): replace `take_sprint` with `take_card(card_id={cardid}, handle="CAMERON")`, or rely on the per-executor `move_to_in_progress` invariant in Phase 1 Step 0a to advance the card. There is no sprint to claim.
- **Phase 0 Step 0a** (migration preflight): runs **identically in single-card mode** — the pending-rewrite halt is not sprint-scoped. A rewrite migration over the corpus is just as dangerous to a single-card dispatch.
- **Phase 0 Step 0b** (verify sprint closeout card exists): **skip entirely in single-card mode.** No closeout card exists for a single-card dispatch — the closeout-card gate is sprint-scoped by construction. The planner injection fields (`closeout_card_id`, `sprint_card_list`) are also unused; planner output in single-card mode just files standalone backlog cards, not closeout-card appendages.
- **Phase 0 Step 1** (sprintmaster): single-card mode has one card; there is no batch to sprintmaster. Skip. Verify the card is in `todo` (or move it there) and dispatch the executor directly.
- **Phase 1–4** (execution loop): one batch, one card, one executor → reviewer → router cycle (plus reruns on rejection). The phase barrier and parallel-batch logic degenerate to "wait for the one card." Everything else (worktree merge-back, completion tag, inbox file conventions) follows the token substitutions above.
- **Phase 5 Step 0b** (done tag cleanup): the `tag -l "{SPRINTTAG}-*-done"` sweep is sprint-scoped. In single-card mode there is at most one tag (`card-{cardid}-done`); delete it explicitly with `git -C "$PARENT" tag -d "card-{cardid}-done" 2>/dev/null || true` and skip the loop.
- **Phase 5 Step 0c** (sprint-closeout-reviewer Gate 0): **skip entirely in single-card mode.** Gate 0's job is to reconcile the *closeout card's* upper-checklist cites against external state — and there is no closeout card. The integrity that Gate 0 enforces at sprint level ("every checked claim is grounded in evidence") is enforced at the card level by the per-card reviewer's Gate 1 checkbox-integrity check. Skipping Gate 0 in single-card mode does not leave the integrity surface unguarded — reviewer Gate 1 already covers it.
- **Progress checkpoints** (see Progress checkpoints near the top of this SKILL): the transition map degenerates. There is no sprintmaster batch and no batch barriers, so emit **no** dispatch-begin and **no** batch-barrier checkpoints; the single card's closeout coincides with sprint close-out, so emit one rich **closeout-at-end** checkpoint (closeout ≡ final) instead of separate closeout and final checkpoints. Halt checkpoints fire unchanged at any stop condition.
- **Phase 5 Steps 1–4** (metrics, archive, commit, report): generate metrics with `--card {cardid}` rather than `--sprint {SPRINTTAG}` if the parser supports it; otherwise skip metrics. Archive the single card via gitban tools. Commit `.gitban/` changes. Report completion (the closeout-at-end checkpoint above). No `take_sprint` to release. The single-card `feature/{cardid}` branch follows the same PR contract as a sprint branch (Phase 5 Step 4): at close-out the dispatcher opens a draft PR against `main` via `/gitban-pr` and may run a `/code-review:code-review` pass, then merges **only** if the user has explicitly asked for the branch to be merged — absent that request it opens + reviews and hands the reviewed PR back.

**What is unchanged.** The per-card lifecycle (executor → reviewer → router → close-out or rework), the worktree isolation contract for executors, the watchdog and stale-detection machinery, the parent-pin convention for write-class git, the gitban MCP health requirement, and the terminal-output rule all apply identically. Single-card mode is a wrapping change in the dispatcher — the executor / reviewer / router / planner SKILLs are not aware of the mode and need no changes.

## Inputs

- **Sprint tag**: provided by the user (sprint mode). Single-card mode takes a **card ID** instead — see the Single-card mode section above for the full delta.
- **Card list**: in sprint mode, use `mcp__gitban__list_cards` with the sprint tag filter. In single-card mode the list is the one card the user named.

## Phase 0: Sprint Readiness

In single-card mode, every step in this phase that operates on a *batch* of cards (Step 0 `take_sprint`, Step 0b closeout-card verify, Step 1 sprintmaster, Step 2 plan review) either skips or degenerates to a single-card form — see the Single-card mode section for the per-step delta. The Step 0 (pre) WIP handling applies identically in both modes.

### Step 0 (sweep): Prune orphan worktree directories (session start)

Run the orphan-worktree sweep helper as the very first thing in a dispatch session, before Step 0 (pre). On Windows the OS keeps file handles open on transient files inside a worktree (`bash.exe.stackdump`, sub-agent log files, `.git` internals) after an executor exits, so the normal cleanup sequence (worktree-remove-force followed by `rm -rf`) leaves locked, git-untracked directories piling up under `.claude/worktrees/` across sessions. The sweep clears every orphan it can and reports the rest at INFO without erroring — it never touches a live, git-tracked worktree:

```bash
bash .gitban/hooks/prune-orphan-worktrees.sh --quiet
```

The helper resolves the parent repo itself (using `--git-common-dir` to pin to the parent regardless of any worktree subdirectory the shell may have drifted into), prunes git's stale worktree metadata, skips any directory still listed by `git worktree list --porcelain` (a running executor's worktree is never removed), removes the rest, and logs directories still locked by the OS at INFO — a locked directory is expected on Windows and is **not** a failure (the helper always exits 0). It is idempotent: the next sweep retries whatever stayed locked. This replaces the ad-hoc `rm -rf "$PARENT/.claude/worktrees/agent-"*` one-liner for routine cleanup — that one-liner aborts the whole loop on the first `Permission denied`, so locked orphans survived every prior session.

### Step 0 (pre): Bring any WIP onto the working branch

Work runs on a branch: `sprint/{SPRINTTAG}` for a sprint, `feature/{cardid}` for a single card.

If the session starts with uncommitted WIP, just create the working branch and bring the WIP onto it (`git -C "$PARENT" checkout -b` keeps your uncommitted changes) — it's probably relevant, and you can decide what to actually commit later, on the branch. Don't stop to ask how to handle WIP; just take it with you and proceed.

### Step 0: Claim ownership

Before creating a branch or dispatching anything, claim all sprint cards on main:

```
mcp__gitban__take_sprint(sprint_name="{SPRINTTAG}", handle="CAMERON")
```

CAMERON is the user's git handle. All dispatched work runs under CAMERON — it does not mean "reserved for manual work."

### Step 0a: Migration preflight (hard requirement — runs before any other Phase 0 setup)

Before verifying the closeout card or dispatching anything, run the state-migration preflight. It runs ONCE at startup (cheap, never-mutating, never-raising — re-checking mid-sprint is unnecessary) and applies in **both** sprint and single-card mode.

Call `mcp__gitban__health_check()` and read its `pending_migrations` block. The block has the shape `{"pending": [<entry>, ...], "errors": [...]}`, where each pending entry carries at least `id`, `class` (`rewrite` or `additive`), `state`, `headline`, and `apply_hint`. The `state` values depend on `class`: a `rewrite` entry is `available` or `interrupted`; an `additive` entry is `behind` (gitban-owned config trails a newer bundle, with a tracking record) or `untracked` (it differs with no tracking record — the dominant just-behind-without-a-record population, NOT a presumed hand-edit). Classify it:

- **HALT** — any pending entry with `class == "rewrite"` and `state` in {`available`, `interrupted`}. This is the **"pending rewrite-class migration detected"** stop condition. Report it as a rich **halt checkpoint** (lead with the stop condition; `Why` = the entry's `headline`; `State` = sprint identity + that no card has dispatched; `Needs you` = run the entry's `apply_hint`, e.g. `apply_migrations(migration_id='0001')`, on a clean tree, then re-start the dispatch). Halt **before** Step 0b — do not verify the closeout card, do not sprintmaster, do not spawn any executor. A rewrite migration rewrites committed history; the dispatcher must not operate on a corpus that is about to be rewritten, and it **NEVER auto-applies** — applying a history rewrite is an explicit human action.
- **PROCEED (report-only)** — an `additive`-only pending set (every pending entry is `class == "additive"`, in state `behind` or `untracked`). A behind-or-untracked gitban-owned config (e.g. a roadmap-schema refresh) is a lighter explicit refresh, not un-migrated history. Note it in the startup checkpoint and continue to Step 0b.
- **PROCEED** — an `errors[]`-only result (detection degraded, e.g. a corrupt corpus), an empty `pending`, or a `health_check` with no `pending_migrations` block at all (an older server). Detection degrading is never a blocker; continue to Step 0b.

The dispatcher reaches migration detection **only through `health_check`** — there is no separate detection tool to call. If `health_check` itself is unavailable or erroring, that is already the "gitban MCP health" hard-halt above; resolve that first.

### Step 0b: Verify the sprint closeout card exists (hard requirement)

**Skip entirely in single-card mode — no closeout card exists for a single-card dispatch.** The integrity surface the closeout card protects is sprint-scoped; in single-card mode the per-card reviewer's Gate 1 checkbox-integrity check is the equivalent protection at the card level. See the Single-card mode section above.

Every sprint MUST have a sprint closeout card (see sprint-architect/SKILL.md). This is a load-bearing invariant: the planner appends non-blocking retrospective items to the closeout card during the sprint, and the closeout card's own acceptance criteria drive the end-of-sprint walk-each-item closeout. If the closeout card is missing, the sprint has no aggregation target — planner classification breaks, tail-spawn returns, and the sprint cannot be closed out cleanly.

Before dispatching any other work, use `mcp__gitban__list_cards` (or `search_cards`) with the sprint tag filter to locate the closeout card. Heuristics: its title contains "Sprint Closeout" or "Closeout", its type is `chore`, and its step number is the final step in the sprint. If no such card exists, **stop immediately** — do not dispatch sprintmaster, do not spawn executors, do not proceed. Surface the missing-closeout error to the user with the sprint tag and a request to ask the sprint-architect (or the user directly) to create the closeout card using the template in sprint-architect/SKILL.md. Resume dispatch only after the closeout card is visible on the board.

Once located, **record the closeout card's ID** in your session state. This ID is injected into every planner and (optionally) executor prompt for the duration of the sprint. Also record the sprint card list (IDs, titles, statuses, short scope descriptions) — this too is injected into planner prompts so the planner can perform its stateless-isolation duplicate-drop pre-step ("Is another in-sprint card already addressing this?") and answer its own blocks-downstream-work question.

### Step 1: Prepare cards for dispatch

Dispatch a `general-purpose` agent to get the cards ready. Tell it what you need — it knows how to use the gitban tools.

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="{SPRINTTAG}-sprintmaster",
  prompt="Sprint tag: {SPRINTTAG}

Hey, I need to dispatch these cards and they're not ready yet. Can you get them into shape for me? Here's what I need:

Cards: {card_list}

What 'ready' means:

1. Every card in todo status. If they're stuck in draft, sort out the validation issues (get_validation_fixes will tell you what's wrong, then edit_card/append_card to fix). If they're in backlog, just move them over.

2. Step numbers in each card title (update_card_metadata) so I know what order to run them:
   - step 1, step 2, step 3 = sequential
   - step 2A, step 2B, step 2C = parallel batch, safe to run at the same time
   - Same number + different letter = no shared files, no dependency
   - Next number = phase barrier, everything before it must finish first
   - P0s before P1s at the same dependency level

3. Figure out the dependencies — which cards touch the same files, which ones need another card done first, which are truly independent. That's how you'll know the step numbers.

4. Assign an owner to each card.

5. Give me back the execution plan — batches, order, and anything you think I should know about.

Important: if a card is fighting you on validation or the scope seems unclear or too big, don't try to be a hero. Flag it and tell me it needs an architect review. Your job is to get cards ready for dispatch, not to redesign them.

Use the gitban tools however you see fit — you know the system better than I do."
)
```

### Step 2: Plan Review

Review the sprintmaster's execution plan yourself before proceeding:
- Are all cards in each parallel batch truly independent?
- Do any batched cards touch the same source files?
- Could any shared test fixtures cause race conditions?
- Are P0 cards sequenced before P1 cards at the same dependency level?

If anything looks wrong, re-sequence using `mcp__gitban__update_card_metadata`. Do not proceed until you are confident.

Once the plan is settled and before dispatching batch 1, post the lean **dispatch-begin checkpoint** (see Progress checkpoints) — the sprint, roadmap node, card/batch counts, branch, and the per-batch card layout — so the watching human sees what is about to run.

## Phase 1–4: Execution Loop

For each step group (in order):

### Pre-batch Review

Before dispatching each batch, check for drift:
- Are the cards in this batch still independent given changes from previous batches?
- Did a previous executor touch files that create new dependencies for this batch?

If drift is detected, re-sequence the remaining cards before proceeding.

**Important: The dispatcher does not use card status as a control signal.** The router's verdict drives sequencing — not the card's `done`/`blocked`/`in_progress` state. Card status is managed by the agents. However, the dispatcher should sanity-check card status after each phase as a health check.

### 1. Dispatch Executors (worktree isolated)

**Pre-dispatch invariants (run these IN ORDER before any `Agent(...)` call in this section):**

0a. **Advance card status BEFORE spawning the executor.** For each card in the batch, call `mcp__gitban__move_to_in_progress` on the card from the DISPATCHER session (where the MCP server is guaranteed reachable) before issuing the Agent call. Worktree sub-agents may not have gitban MCP tools loaded, so they cannot be relied on to advance the card themselves. If the move fails (card already in_progress, locked, contested by another session), stop and surface the error — do not spawn a parallel executor on a contested card. The invariant: **no card may be `todo` while an executor is actively working on it.**

0b. **Push the sprint branch before spawning.** Run `git -C "$PARENT" push origin sprint/{SPRINTTAG}` (where `PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"`) and wait for it to complete successfully. This MUST happen AFTER any card-creation, status-advance, or branch-local commits have been made, and BEFORE the first Agent call. Worktree executors merge `origin/sprint/{SPRINTTAG}` on startup — if the dispatcher has unpushed commits on the local sprint branch, those commits (and any card files they introduced) are invisible to the worktree until the push lands. Missing the push silently loses cards.

   **Fail-fast on rejection.** If `git -C "$PARENT" push` reports a non-fast-forward, hook rejection, or auth failure, STOP. Do not spawn any executors. Fix the push, commit any needed artefacts, and re-run the phase from the start. The executors you skipped will be picked up on the retry.

   **Idempotency.** `git -C "$PARENT" push` with no new commits is a no-op and is safe to re-run, so this step has no "already done" path — always run it at the top of every dispatch phase.

0c. **Architectural-bridge check.** Before dispatching an executor for a card whose scope includes bridging subsystems, unifying partitions, reconciling naming across subsystems, or closing an architectural gap, confirm: (a) a design doc exists that walks at least one real-data path end-to-end through the proposed bridge, and (b) the card's acceptance criteria derive from that design doc. If either condition is missing, pause dispatch and surface the gap to the user — even if the card looks plausible and the sprint is mid-flight. "Just one more phase" is a common cover for skipping this check.

0d. **Worktree base-branch verification.** Claude Code's built-in `isolation: "worktree"` forks new worktrees from `origin/{default-branch}` (typically `origin/main`) rather than the dispatcher's current HEAD — see [anthropics/claude-code#27876](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/27876). That breaks every feature/sprint branch workflow, because the worktree starts out missing all of the sprint's commits. This project ships a `WorktreeCreate` hook at `.gitban/hooks/worktree-create.sh` that replaces the default and forks from current HEAD instead. Verify the hook is active before dispatching executors:

   ```bash
   grep -q "WorktreeCreate" .claude/settings.json && test -x .gitban/hooks/worktree-create.sh && echo "hook ok" || echo "HOOK MISSING"
   ```

   If the check reports `HOOK MISSING`, **abort dispatch** and surface this to the user verbatim:

   > Abort: worktree would fork from `main` instead of `sprint/{SPRINTTAG}`. Run `gitban setup --force` to install the `WorktreeCreate` hook, or manually restore `.gitban/hooks/worktree-create.sh` and the `WorktreeCreate` entry in `.claude/settings.json`. See [anthropics/claude-code#27876](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/27876) for background on why the default behavior is wrong for branch-based workflows.

   Also run `git -C "$PARENT" worktree prune` to clear any orphaned worktrees from a prior crashed session — orphans can nest new worktrees inside stale ones and inherit bad branch bases. If orphans remain after prune (`git -C "$PARENT" worktree list` shows stale paths), clean them explicitly before dispatching. The explicit `for ref in $(...)` loop replaces the previous xargs pipeline (the `xargs` form would have hidden the inner write-class git from the cwd-pin hook's segment-tokeniser scan) — both git invocations are pinned end-to-end, and every iteration of the loop names the work tree on its command line for audit-log readability:

   ```bash
   PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"
   bash .gitban/hooks/prune-orphan-worktrees.sh --quiet
   git -C "$PARENT" worktree prune
   for ref in $(git -C "$PARENT" for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/worktree-agent-*); do
     git -C "$PARENT" branch -D "$ref"
   done
   ```

   The sweep helper replaces the bare `rm -rf "$PARENT/.claude/worktrees/agent-"*` here: that one-liner aborts on the first OS-locked directory (`Permission denied` on Windows), so a single locked orphan from a prior crash blocked cleanup of every other orphan. The helper skips live git-tracked worktrees, removes what it can, and reports locked directories at INFO without erroring.

   After each executor completes, sanity-check the base regardless: `git -C "$PARENT" merge-base --is-ancestor sprint/{SPRINTTAG} worktree-agent-{id}` (exit 0 = valid). A wrong base still means reject-and-re-dispatch — the hook is belt-and-suspenders, not load-bearing.

**Dispatch:**

For each card in the batch, dispatch an `executor` using the template and polling loop above.

- Worktree venv resolution is automatic via `scripts/venv-python` — no setup script needed; the helper resolves the correct `.venv` in both parent-repo and worktree contexts.
- If batch has multiple cards, dispatch the executors **one per message** — issue one executor Agent call, wait for it to return its short ID, then issue the next in a fresh message. Do **not** batch executors into a single message, and do **not** combine an executor Agent call with any other Agent call in the same message: the `WorktreeCreate` hook gets `Hook cancelled` (Claude Code bug [anthropics/claude-code#62422](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/62422); see the Worktree-isolated agents constraint above). Start each executor's watchdog right after its dispatch. This serializes executor spawn (not execution — once spawned they run concurrently); revert to batched dispatch when #62422 is fixed.
- If an agent goes stale, follow the stale detection recovery procedure
- **Hung-executor check — before you merge, confirm the executor actually produced commits.** A turn-budget-exhausted executor returns silently with a clean worktree, no commits on its branch, and (usually) no completion tag — see the executor SKILL's *Before you return* self-check for the failure shape. Trusting the executor's completion claim and merging anyway gives you a `--no-edit` merge that reports "Already up to date" and a card the reviewer will reject as empty. Verify git state first:
  ```bash
  PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"
  if [ -z "$(git -C "$PARENT" log --oneline sprint/{SPRINTTAG}..worktree-agent-{id})" ]; then
    echo "HUNG EXECUTOR: worktree-agent-{id} has zero commits since fork — do NOT merge"
  fi
  ```
  Zero commits since the fork point = hung executor. Do **not** merge. Clean up the
  worktree (`git -C "$PARENT" worktree remove --force {path}`,
  `git -C "$PARENT" branch -D worktree-agent-{id}`, `git -C "$PARENT" worktree prune`)
  and re-dispatch the executor with an explicit note in the prompt to use the canonical
  `Bash(run_in_background:true)` + `TaskOutput(block:true)` wait pattern rather than
  `Monitor` for any long-running test. A missing completion tag alongside zero commits is
  corroborating evidence; the commit count is the load-bearing signal (a successful
  executor that merely forgot to tag still has commits worth merging).
- Once the hung-executor check passes, merge the worktree branch back to the sprint branch. Every git invocation in this block is pinned to `$PARENT` — the merge MUST land on the parent repo's sprint branch, never on the worktree this dispatch session may have drifted into:
  ```bash
  PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"
  git -C "$PARENT" merge worktree-agent-{id} --no-edit
  git -C "$PARENT" tag -d "{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-done" 2>/dev/null
  git -C "$PARENT" worktree remove --force {path}
  git -C "$PARENT" branch -D worktree-agent-{id}
  ```
- **Reconcile parent card-state — merge first, reconcile second (this ordering is a gate, not a style choice).** The executor commits *code only* and never commits the worktree's `.gitban/` copy, so card-state mutations made via MCP during the dispatch live **uncommitted in the parent working tree** until you stage them here. Reconcile *after* the merge above, while that parent card state is still uncommitted:
  ```bash
  git -C "$PARENT" add .gitban/
  git -C "$PARENT" commit -m "chore(gitban): reconcile card state for {SPRINTTAG}"
  ```
  Order is load-bearing: **merge first, reconcile second.** Reconciling before the merge converts a protective merge-abort into a content conflict on card markdown. If the `git -C "$PARENT" merge` above aborts with "local changes would be overwritten" on a `.gitban/cards/*.md` path, an executor committed a stale card copy — inspect it, discard the stale worktree copy, and do **not** force the merge or resolve with a blind `-X ours`/`-X theirs`.
- Run `git -C "$PARENT" worktree prune` before proceeding

#### Post-merge checklist

After all worktrees in a batch are merged:
- **Run tests** on the merged sprint branch to catch integration issues between parallel changes. Remember: no piping or output redirection (see top-level rule). Use pytest flags (`-q`, `--tb=line`, `--no-header`, `--timeout=30`) to control verbosity.
- **Run project-specific validation** (if the project defines it): inspect the project for build/test targets such as `Makefile` rules, `tox.ini` envs, `package.json` scripts, or a documented CI entrypoint. Run them concretely on the merged sprint branch (e.g., `make build`, `make test`, `npm run test`). Do not defer this to CI — failures found here cost one dispatcher cycle; failures found in CI cost a full rework cycle.
- **Regenerate derived artifacts** (manifests, generated code, etc.) if multiple executors touched source files that feed into them — individual executors may have regenerated in their worktree, but the merged result needs a final pass
- **Check for "Already up to date"** on any merge — this means the executor committed to the sprint branch instead of its worktree branch. Verify the changes are present; if not, investigate.

### 2. Dispatch Reviewers (main thread)

Every executor cycle gets reviewed. The reviewer is what catches over-claiming, half-done checkboxes, and quietly-narrowed acceptance criteria — skipping it leaves the dispatcher with no second pair of eyes on what landed.

For each card in the batch, dispatch a `reviewer` using the template and polling loop above.

- Get the commit hash from the merge commit or `git log`
- Review number N = 1 for first review, increment on re-review
- If batch has multiple cards, dispatch all in parallel

### 3. Dispatch Routers (main thread)

For each reviewed card, dispatch a `router` using the template and polling loop above.

- If batch has multiple cards, dispatch all in parallel

### 4. Process Router Verdicts

Read the router's output files to determine the verdict for each card:

**APPROVAL** → dispatch a close-out agent using the pattern above. Once the card reaches `done`, post the rich **closeout checkpoint** (see Progress checkpoints) — this is the canonical, most-frequent checkpoint. Source **Did** from the router verdict + reviewer result you just read; source **Changed** from the delta accumulator below; source the header counts from the sprint card list vs. cards now in `done`.
**BLOCKERS** → dispatch an `executor` agent (N incremented). The full loop repeats: executor → reviewer → router. Do NOT skip the reviewer on re-work. Record the rework in your delta accumulator so the next closeout checkpoint's **Changed** line reflects it.
**PLANNER WORK** → dispatch a planner agent using the pattern above. Non-blocking relative to executor sequencing — planners don't gate the next batch. But "non-blocking" does not mean "safe to forget." The planner feeds follow-up work back into the current sprint, extending it to absorb its own findings. If a planner fails, retry it once before moving on (transient failures like permission bugs and tool timeouts are the common case, not genuine rejection). Log the full error message on failure (see Dispatch Log section).

**Delta accumulator (for the closeout checkpoint's "Changed" line).** As you process verdicts, keep a small running note in context of what changed since the last closeout checkpoint: planner follow-up cards filed (Step 5), deferrals and rework you routed, and any scope change you observed. The next closeout checkpoint drains this note into its **Changed** row (IDs only), then you reset it. This is reconciled against gitban, not diffed from it — best-effort and never blocking.

### 5. Check for new sprint cards from the planner

After processing all verdicts for a batch, re-read the sprint card list. The planner extends the sprint by adding new cards with step numbers. If new cards appear in `todo` status with step numbers, they become part of the remaining execution plan — treat them like any other sprint card and dispatch them in their sequenced order. This is the self-healing loop: tech debt discovered during the sprint gets resolved in the same sprint.

### 6. Generate Phase Metrics

After all verdicts for this batch are processed (approvals closed out, rework dispatched, planners dispatched), run the parser to append metrics for this phase to the dispatch log:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/parse-agent-logs.py --sprint {SPRINTTAG} --phase {N} >> .gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md
```

If the parser exits with code 1 (no logs found), skip and continue. Agents may not have emitted JSONL logs if they were not instrumented.

Then post the lean **batch-barrier checkpoint** (see Progress checkpoints): which batch just finished (card IDs ✓), the running closed/total, and the next batch's lead card. This one line **is** the human-facing form of these phase metrics — the heavier table above stays in the dispatch log; do not emit a second, near-duplicate summary to the conversation.

### 7. Repeat

Move to the next step group (including any new cards the planner added to the sprint). Continue until all router verdicts for all cards are APPROVAL and close-out agents have completed.

## Dispatch Log

Maintain an append-only log at `.gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md`. After each phase completion, append an entry with:
- Timestamp
- Phase/step completed
- Cards processed and results
- Merge status
- Any drift detected
- **Agent failures**: log the full error message, tool name, and card ID — not just "Error (non-blocking, backlog items deferred)." A resuming dispatcher (or a human) needs the actual error to diagnose and recover.

This enables crash recovery — a new dispatcher session can read the log and resume.

### Agent Performance Metrics

Agents emit structured JSONL trace logs via the `agent-trace.sh` PreToolUse hook to `.gitban/agents/traces/`. After each phase completes, the dispatcher runs `scripts/parse-agent-logs.py` to generate metrics tables and appends them to the dispatch log. Use `--breakdown` for time-per-activity analysis.

**After each phase** (immediately after processing router verdicts):

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/parse-agent-logs.py --sprint {SPRINTTAG} --phase {N} >> .gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md
```

This produces a table like:

```
### Phase 1: Step 1 (abc123)

| Agent | Tokens | Tools | Duration |
|:------|-------:|------:|---------:|
| executor-1 | -- | 131 | 23m |
| reviewer-1 | -- | 33 | 3m |
| router-1 | -- | 9 | 1m |
| **Phase total** | **--** | **173** | **27m** |
```

**At sprint close-out** (Phase 5, before archiving):

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/parse-agent-logs.py --sprint {SPRINTTAG} --summary >> .gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md
```

This produces a summary table like:

```
## Sprint Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|:-------|------:|
| Cards completed | 5 |
| Total agent dispatches | 19 |
| Total tokens | -- |
| Total tool uses | 650 |
| Total wall time | 2h 15m |
| Rework cycles | 1 (53px1p) |
| Backlog cards created | -- |
```

**Fallback:** If the parser finds no JSONL logs (e.g., agents did not emit logs), fall back to logging agent result metadata (`total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms`) manually as before. The parser output is preferred when available.

This data is used for profiling and optimizing agent performance across sprints.

## Phase 5: Sprint Close-out

**ONLY run Phase 5 when the ENTIRE sprint is complete.** That means every card the user assigned to this dispatch has received an APPROVAL verdict and its close-out agent has finished. If you were given a subset of cards from a larger sprint, Phase 5 does NOT apply — commit your work and stop. The sprint stays open for the next dispatch.

**Do NOT archive cards mid-sprint.** Completed cards stay in `done` status on the board until the sprint closes. This keeps the done pile visible for progress tracking and retrospectives — just like a real scrum board.

When (and only when) the full sprint is complete:

0. **Backlog verification**: Before generating metrics, cross-reference router-identified backlog items (from router output files) against actual cards on the board. If a router routed N items to a planner and fewer than N cards exist, the planner dropped work. Re-dispatch the planner for the missing items before proceeding.

0b. **Done tag cleanup**: Sweep any leftover done tags for this sprint. The explicit `for tag in $(...)` loop replaces the previous xargs pipeline (the `xargs` form would have hidden the inner write-class git from the cwd-pin hook's segment-tokeniser scan) — both git invocations are pinned to `$PARENT`, and every iteration names the work tree on its command line for audit-log readability:
   ```bash
   PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"
   for tag in $(git -C "$PARENT" tag -l "{SPRINTTAG}-*-done"); do
     git -C "$PARENT" tag -d "$tag"
   done
   ```

   In single-card mode the sweep pattern is `card-{cardid}-done` (at most one tag), so the loop collapses to a single delete: `git -C "$PARENT" tag -d "card-{cardid}-done" 2>/dev/null || true`.

0c. **Sprint-closeout-reviewer Gate 0 — hard precondition for the closeout commit.**

   **Skip entirely in single-card mode.** Gate 0 reconciles the *closeout card's* upper-checklist cites against external state — there is no closeout card to reconcile in single-card mode. The per-card reviewer's Gate 1 checkbox-integrity check is the equivalent protection at the card level. See the Single-card mode section near the top of this SKILL.

   Before staging or committing the closeout card's archival edits (Step 2 below), the dispatcher MUST invoke the sprint-closeout-reviewer's Gate 0 runner against the sprint's closeout card. Gate 0 reconciles the closeout body's upper completion checklist (each ticked box must carry a `<!-- cite: <kind>:<value> -->` annotation that resolves against committed evidence and external state) against external truth (sprint-branch CI status, in_progress card list, roadmap path status). This is the structural reconciliation that makes UIPOL7A-shape closeout self-deception (`9padx1`: ticked "All tests passing" / "Code reviewed and merged" while the same body's retro recorded freshness-indicator CI-green observation as deferred) impossible. See postmortem `ouzhq4` §5 for the worked failure case Gate 0 exists to block.

   See `.claude/skills/gitban-sprint-closeout-reviewer/SKILL.md` for the full Gate 0 spec — cite grammar, verdict semantics, return-dict shape.

   **Invocation (always strict for dispatcher use):**

   ```
   mcp__gitban__gate0(card_id={closeout_card_id}, sprint="{SPRINTTAG}", strict_external=true)
   ```

   Use the `closeout_card_id` recorded in Phase 0 Step 0b. Pass `sprint` explicitly even though the tool can infer it — explicit beats inferred at the dispatcher layer.

   **Verdict handling (read the `verdict` field on the returned dict):**

   | Verdict | Action |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | `"PASS"` | Proceed to Step 1 (metrics) and Step 2 (archive + commit). |
   | `"FAIL"` | **Refuse the closeout commit.** Read the `failures` list from the returned dict, surface the `box_text` / `cite` / `failure_kind` / `evidence` rows verbatim to the user, and dispatch a planner (or escalate to the user) to file fix-up cards. Do NOT tick "Code reviewed and merged" — Gate 0 just told you that claim contradicts external state. Re-invoke Gate 0 after the closeout body is corrected. |
   | `"INPUT_ERROR"` | Refuse the closeout commit. Surface the `error` field — the closeout card id or sprint tag is wrong. Fix and re-invoke. |
   | `"EXTERNAL_PROBE_ERROR"` | Refuse the closeout commit. The runner could not probe CI / roadmap / card state (network, permissions, or rate limit). Record the probe failure in the closeout body, then re-invoke with `strict_external=false` ONLY after a human has confirmed CI status by reading the dashboard directly. The retry MUST be logged in the dispatch log so the audit trail captures the soft-bypass. |

   The closeout commit is the moment the dispatcher hands the sprint back to the user as "done." Gate 0 is the structural check that the closeout body's claims line up with external truth — exactly because the dispatcher cannot judge that itself from the closeout's prose alone (see postmortem `ouzhq4` §5 for the worked failure case). If the tool is unreachable (MCP server down, tool not registered, internal exception), surface to the user and stop; do not improvise a verdict.

   **Where the verdict JSON lives.** Serialise the returned dict and write it to `.gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-gate0-{utc-stamp}.json` so the closeout retrospective and any post-incident review can replay the verdict that was acted on. Do not mutate that file after the fact.

   Example wire-up (pseudo-flow inside the dispatcher-as-LLM):

   ```
   result = mcp__gitban__gate0(
     card_id={closeout_card_id},
     sprint="{SPRINTTAG}",
     strict_external=true,
   )
   gate0_path = ".gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-gate0-{utc-yyyymmddhhmm}.json"
   # Serialise result to gate0_path (Write tool) for audit replay.
   match result["verdict"]:
     case "PASS":
       proceed to Step 1 (metrics) and Step 2 (archive + commit)
     case "FAIL":
       refuse closeout commit; surface result["failures"] verbatim;
       dispatch planner to file fix-up cards; re-loop
     case "INPUT_ERROR":
       refuse closeout commit; surface result["error"]; fix and re-invoke
     case "EXTERNAL_PROBE_ERROR":
       refuse closeout commit; record probe failure in closeout body;
       human-confirm CI dashboard; retry with strict_external=false;
       log soft-bypass in dispatch log
   ```

1. Generate sprint summary metrics:
   ```bash
   .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/parse-agent-logs.py --sprint {SPRINTTAG} --summary >> .gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md
   ```
2. Archive all done cards for the sprint using gitban tools
3. Commit all `.gitban/` changes
4. Open and review the sprint PR, then report completion to the user. At close-out the dispatcher carries the branch all the way to a reviewed PR:
   - Push the sprint branch (`git -C "$PARENT" push origin sprint/{SPRINTTAG}`, with `PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"`), then draft a PR against `main` with the `/gitban-pr` skill (or a `pr` subagent).
   - Optionally run a `/code-review:code-review` pass and surface the findings.
   - Merge only if the user asks, and not past a red check.
   - **Post the final checkpoint.** As the close-out report, emit the rich **final checkpoint** (see Progress checkpoints): sprint result (`done`/total), roadmap node, wall time + avg/card, the draft PR number with its open-and-reviewed-but-not-merged state, and the follow-up count routed to backlog. This is the one checkpoint the returning user is most likely to read first.
5. **Session-end orphan sweep.** Run the orphan-worktree sweep helper one last time so leftover `agent-*` directories from this session's merged executors do not carry over to the next dispatch. Same helper as the session-start sweep (Phase 0 Step 0 (sweep)); directories still locked by the OS are reported at INFO and cleared by a future sweep — exit is always 0, so this never blocks close-out:
   ```bash
   bash .gitban/hooks/prune-orphan-worktrees.sh
   ```
   (Omit `--quiet` here so the close-out log captures the per-directory cleaned/locked detail.)

**If only a batch of cards was dispatched (not the full sprint):** commit all `.gitban/` changes to the sprint branch and stop. Do NOT archive, and do NOT open a PR — the PR is a full-sprint-close-out action. Still run the session-end orphan sweep (`bash .gitban/hooks/prune-orphan-worktrees.sh`) before stopping — orphan directories accumulate per batch, not just per full sprint.

## Agent Inboxes

All inter-agent communication goes through versioned inbox files:

```
.gitban/agents/reviewer/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-reviewer-{N}.md
.gitban/agents/executor/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-executor-{N}.md
.gitban/agents/planner/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-planner-{N}.md
.gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md
```

## Key Conventions

- **Phase barrier**: all agents in a batch must complete and merge before the next batch starts
- **Review is mandatory**: every executor cycle produces a review. The dispatcher cannot skip reviews.
- **Router verdict drives sequencing**: the dispatcher reads router verdicts and dispatches accordingly.
- **Only executors use worktree isolation**: reviewers, routers, planners, and close-out agents run on the main thread.
- **Worktree cleanup**: after each executor completes, merge its branch, remove the worktree, delete the branch. Run `git worktree prune` before each new batch.
- **MCP tools hit main repo**: card edits from any worktree land on the main `.gitban/` directory
- **Long paths on Windows**: ensure `git config core.longpaths true` is set
- **No co-authored-by lines** in commits
- **Pre-commit hooks must run on every dispatcher commit.** The dispatcher is a merge gate — executor / reviewer / planner / router skip hooks on intermediate worktree commits, but dispatcher commits to `.gitban/` and merge commits MUST verify. Never `--no-verify` from the dispatcher.
- **PRs**: After close-out, draft a PR against `main` with the `/gitban-pr` skill, optionally review it with `/code-review:code-review`, and merge it only if the user asks.
- **Closeout commits go through Gate 0**: Phase 5 Step 0c. No skip path in sprint mode. FAIL/INPUT_ERROR/EXTERNAL_PROBE_ERROR/uncaught-exception all refuse the commit. Single-card mode skips Gate 0 by construction (no closeout card) — see the Single-card mode section.
- **No output piping**: No `|`, `>`, `2>&1`, `tee`, or any output redirection in Bash commands. See the terminal output rule at the top.
- **Progress checkpoints**: emit exactly one per loop transition — dispatch-begin (lean), closeout (rich, the canonical one), batch-barrier (lean, replaces a second Phase-Metrics summary), halt (rich, on any stop condition), final (rich). Lean, self-contained, best-effort; gitban holds the full record. See the Progress checkpoints section.
- **Stage with `git -C "$PARENT" add .gitban/`** (with `PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"`): always stage the entire `.gitban/` directory, never cherry-pick specific files — partial staging causes orphaned renames (old file tracked, new file untracked) that create duplicates.

## Operational Notes

Things the dispatcher should be aware of that aren't covered by the phase instructions above.

### Merge conflicts

Parallel worktree executors can produce merge conflicts even when cards touch different functions in the same file. When this happens:
- If a rework executor rewrote a file that the original also created (e.g. a test file), take the rework version (`git -C "$PARENT" checkout --theirs`, with `PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"`)
- If the conflict is between two independent cards, resolve by keeping both changes
- Never use `--no-verify` or skip hooks to work around a conflict

### Pre-commit hook failures on dispatcher commits

Pre-commit hooks may auto-fix issues (line endings, path lengths, formatting) when the dispatcher commits `.gitban/` changes. When a hook auto-fixes and fails the commit:
- Re-stage the modified files (`git -C "$PARENT" add` the changed paths, with `PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"`)
- Create a new commit (do not amend)

### Parallelizing across verdict types

When processing router verdicts, independent actions have no dependencies on each other, but they are **not** all batchable in one message — the worktree-isolation constraint splits them into two groups:

- **Main-thread roles (no worktree):** close-out agents for approved cards and planner agents for follow-up items. These may go out together in a single parallel dispatch.
- **Rework executors for rejected cards (worktree-isolated):** these must each go out **one per message** — never combined with the close-out/planner batch, and never with each other. A rework executor is a worktree-isolated Agent call, so batching it with any other Agent call triggers the `WorktreeCreate ... Hook cancelled` bug ([anthropics/claude-code#62422](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/62422); see the **Worktree-isolated agents** constraint above).

So: send the close-out + planner agents together in one message, then issue each rework executor in its own separate message. When #62422 is resolved, revert to batching rework executors with the rest.

### Continuing an existing dispatch log

When dispatching a new batch of cards for a sprint that already has a dispatch log, append to it. Use a clear separator (e.g. `## Batch 2: Cards ...`) to distinguish batches. Do not overwrite or restructure existing log entries.

### Claude Code false positive: "user doesn't want to proceed"

The error message `"The user doesn't want to proceed with this tool use"` is a known Claude Code false positive — it can fire spuriously on git and MCP tool calls when no user interaction occurred. Do not treat this as an intentional stop signal. If an agent fails with this exact message, retry automatically. This applies to all agent types but is most commonly seen with planners and close-out agents.

### Crash recovery

If a dispatcher session ends mid-sprint, a new session recovers by reading the dispatch log and classifying in-flight cards by branch and tag state.

**Step 1: Read the dispatch log.**
Read `.gitban/agents/dispatcher/inbox/{SPRINTTAG}-dispatch-log.md` to determine which phases completed. Cards with logged APPROVAL verdicts and successful merges are done — skip them.

**Step 2: Check for error files.**
Check for `-ERROR.md` files in agent inboxes — these indicate agents that failed mid-work and wrote diagnostics before exiting. The error files contain enough context to re-dispatch without re-reading the full card.

**Step 3: Classify in-flight cards.**
For each card that was dispatched but not logged as complete:

| Check | State | Recovery |
|:------|:------|:---------|
| `git tag -l "{SPRINTTAG}-{cardid}-done"` returns a tag | **Done** | Merge the worktree branch (if not already merged), clean up worktree, proceed to review |
| `git log sprint/{SPRINTTAG}..worktree-agent-{id} --oneline` shows commits but no done tag | **Partial** | Merge the partial work, re-dispatch executor with inbox note: "Previous executor completed partial work (commits: {hashes}). Continue from where it left off." |
| No commits on worktree branch, or branch doesn't exist | **Not started** | Re-dispatch from scratch |

**Step 4: Resume the execution loop.**
With all cards classified, resume from the earliest incomplete phase. Cards classified as "done" enter the review queue. Cards classified as "partial" or "not started" enter the executor queue.

**Step 5: Clean up stale worktrees BEFORE re-dispatching.**
Orphaned worktrees from a crashed session can cause new executors to branch from `main` instead of the sprint branch, or to nest worktrees inside other worktrees (inheriting stale branch bases). Clean them up before any re-dispatch. The explicit `for ref in $(...)` loop replaces the previous xargs pipeline (the `xargs` form would have hidden the inner write-class git from the cwd-pin hook's segment-tokeniser scan) — both git invocations are pinned to `$PARENT`, and every iteration names the work tree on its command line for audit-log readability:
```bash
PARENT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"
git -C "$PARENT" worktree list
bash .gitban/hooks/prune-orphan-worktrees.sh --quiet   # sweep orphans from the crashed session (skips live worktrees, tolerates OS-locked dirs)
git -C "$PARENT" worktree prune
for ref in $(git -C "$PARENT" for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/worktree-agent-*); do
  git -C "$PARENT" branch -D "$ref"
done
```
After cleanup, `git -C "$PARENT" worktree list` should show only the main worktree. Only then re-dispatch.

### Hung agent recovery

When a watchdog marks an agent as stale and the dispatcher kills it via `TaskStop`:

1. **Log everything** in the dispatch log: agent type, card ID, idle duration, last tool call from the `.stale` file, and whether partial work was found.
2. **For executors with partial commits:** Merge the partial work before re-dispatching. The new executor's error file tells it what remains.
3. **For agents with no commits:** Re-dispatch from scratch. The work is lost but the card and inbox files are intact.
4. **Max retries:** Re-dispatch a failed agent at most once. If the re-dispatch also goes stale, escalate to the user — something is systematically wrong (e.g., MCP server down, API errors).
